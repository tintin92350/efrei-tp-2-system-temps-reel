/**
 * @brief Main entry point of the program.
 * Register a signal handler and wait for 10 seconds
 * 
 * observation: During the 5 seconds the signalHandler function 
 * is called we can send several signals (SIGUSR1) but only 2 will
 * be taken in consideration because the process has only a memory of
 * 2 signals and will forget any other received signals during this time. 
 * 
 * Upgrade: 
 * Why is the process ignoring the others signals ?
 * Because we send too many signals and it will only process 1 signal a time
 * and store another one in waiting state.
 * 
 * Why is this happening ?
 * Because signalhandler function is taking too much time
 * 
 * How to avoid this behaviour ?
 * We need to reduce the time of signalhandler.
 * In order to do that, we can process the signalhandler work in another 
 * thread. 
 * 
 * observation: With that method, we can catch all signal we need. But
 * the process is not totally done because only one signal is remembered by
 * the process one a time. So when we send 10 signals a time, in this window
 * we only treat 1 signal.
 * 
 * How to avoid that ?
 * We do an infinite loop that will process for 'n' signals.
 * 'n' increase when a signal is received by signalhandler
 * and decreased when a signal is treatd.
 * 
 * observation: need to protect the numberOfSignal for concurrency
 * 
 * Exemple of output:
 * $ process pid      8488
 * $ Handling signal : 10
 * $ Handling signal : 10
 * $ Handling signal : 10
 * $          Work begin
 * $          Work ended
 * $          Work begin
 * $          Work ended
 * $          Work ended
 * $          Work begin
 * $          Work ended
 * 
 * @param argc 
 * @param argv 
 * @return int
